{"name":"Fire Warden","tagline":"IoT Fire Alarm (features: smoke/CO2 sensors, occupancy sensor, image recognition, alerts)","body":"## Inspiration\r\n\r\nWe wanted to create an integrated solution for fire safety among the general public.  Many people die every year from smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. The recent death of a mother and her daughter inside of a car due to carbon monoxide inspired us to come up with a solution to save lives. We wanted to come up with a system that could help fire fighters find victims quickly and prevent false alarms. \r\n\r\n![img1](http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/795/datas/gallery.jpg)\r\n\r\n## What it does\r\n\r\nFeatures of the Flame Warden Alarm system\r\n\r\n* Smoke and carbon monoxide sensor\r\n* Blinking LEDs and loud buzzer sound\r\n* Additional layer of fire validation via real time video analysis\r\n* Immediate alert to the authorities and registered users of a potential threat (SMS and Email)\r\n* Mobile application\r\n* Locationing of people within the hazardous area\r\n* Live image of the hazard area with count of people and type of threat\r\n\r\n## How we built it\r\n\r\n![img](http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/341/014/datas/gallery.jpg)\r\nTechnologies: \r\n\r\n* Raspberry Pi\r\n* Camera / Touch Screen\r\n* Hardware Sensors (CO/Gas module/LED)\r\n* Mobile programming (iOS)\r\n* Image processing and detection (OpenCV) \r\n* Cloud Deployment (Digital Ocean) \r\n\r\n## Challenges we ran into Fire Warden\r\n\r\nHardware:\r\n\r\n* Sensors did not have documentation. \r\n* Learning the Rasberry Pi GPIO controls. \r\n* Push notifications in ILS. \r\n* Image processing figuring out correct motion detection for identification of fire origin. \r\n* Setting up the hardware (camera installation/driver installation/enabling i/o)\r\n\r\nSoftware:\r\n* Learning how to better use iOS UI development.\r\n* Compilation in Rasberry Pi of Open CV libraries. \r\n* Lack of knowledge of Python (sensors)\r\n* HTTPS communication did not work by default on iOS\r\n\r\n## Accomplishments that we're proud of\r\n We achieved MVP quickly and were able to finish our stretch goals. We were able to deploy a full end to end solution that could be deployed commercially. We were able to get all of our sensors working. A lot of us worked with technology we never used before yet we were able to complete our solution. We also traveled a far distance on little sleep yet were able to stay up late into the night.\r\n\r\n## What's next for Flame Warden\r\n\r\n* Flesh out the proximity sensor\r\n* Add on full onboarding and configuration for iOS\r\n* Expand to Android\r\n* Expand to web\r\n* Make a desktop UI application that runs for the Rasberry Pi\r\n* Better and accurate fire detection (combination of infrared and image algos) \r\n* Build nice form factor case for product \r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\n![img](http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/789/datas/gallery.jpg)\r\n![img](http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/773/datas/gallery.jpg)\r\n![img](http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/830/datas/gallery.jpg)\r\n![img](http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/779/datas/gallery.jpg)\r\n![img](http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/785/datas/gallery.jpg)\r\n![img](http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/828/datas/gallery.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
